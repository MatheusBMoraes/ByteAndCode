      <h2>Welcome</h2>
      <p>Welcome to Byte & Board, a digital board game about computer science and phrasal verbs!</p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>Game Objective</h2>
      <p>Be the first player to reach the FINAL square, overcoming challenges, bosses, and obstacles along the way.</p>

      <h2>How to Play</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Players take turns rolling the virtual dice (click the <span class="dice">üé≤</span> button).</li>
        <li>The pawn advances the number of squares rolled.</li>
        <li>When landing on a special square:
          <ul>
            <li><span class="prize">Prize Square (blue/üõ°Ô∏è):</span> Gain a FIREWALL (protection in the next boss fight).</li>
            <li><span class="penalty">Penalty Square (yellow/‚ö†Ô∏è):</span> Move back a random number of squares (1 to 6).</li>
            <li><span class="boss">Boss Square (red/üëπ):</span> Start a boss fight (modal).</li>
            <li><span class="neutral">Neutral Square (gray):</span> Nothing happens.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Boss Fight:</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>A challenge about computer science phrasal verbs appears in the center of the screen.</li>
            <li>Type the correct answer to defeat the boss and advance.</li>
            <li>If you make a mistake, try again until you get it right.</li>
            <li>If you have a FIREWALL, one mistake is forgiven.</li>
            <li>You cannot advance without defeating the boss.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>The game ends when a player reaches the FINAL square (30).</li>
      </ol>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>Special Rules</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>You cannot skip boss squares: if the dice roll would pass a boss, the pawn stops at the boss square.</li>
        <li>The FIREWALL is automatically consumed if you make a mistake in the boss fight.</li>
        <li>The turn only passes to the next player after resolving the penalty or defeating the boss.</li>
        <li>All game messages are in English, except this manual (if in Portuguese).</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

      <h2>Tips</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Phrasal verbs are common English expressions in computer science, such as: <em>log in, back up, set up, scroll down, plug in, shut down, look up, break down</em>.</li>
        <li>Read the boss challenge carefully and try to remember the computer science context.</li>
      </ul>
